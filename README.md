# BrandPeek ðŸ‘‹

BrandPeek is a React Native mobile application built with Expo that provides a "Brand Discovery" experience. The app allows users to browse top brands, view detailed brand information, and interact with a clean, modern interface featuring custom gradient backgrounds.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Setup MockAPI Backend

   Follow the detailed setup guide in `docs/mockapi-setup.md` to create your MockAPI project and populate it with brand data.

   After setting up MockAPI, update the `BASE_URL` in `constants/api.js` with your project URL.

3. Validate your setup

   ```bash
   npm run validate-setup
   ```

4. Test your API endpoints

   ```bash
   npm run test-api
   ```

5. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
